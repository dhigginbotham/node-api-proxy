## node-api-proxy (napip)
along came a spider, this spider needed to proxy api's to test them, build out other things that relied heavily on pointless roundtrips. in comes `request` and `nedb/mongodb` to the rescue. once i found these gems i wrote `localize-api` in `CoffeeScript` later i decided i'd like to go back to javascript, so here we are -- same api, just manually refactored to plain ole javascript.
